# 3D Pulsar Data

## (a.k.a. _Unknown Pleasures_ generator)

This is a quick (very quick!) page to generate 3D models like [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3727917). That one was made in OpenSCAD using `rotate_extrude` on some DXF data provided in an [earlier model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92971). This page uses JSCAD so it can run entirely in your browser.

It's been about two years since I've used React, so I'm quite rusty! Please let me know if my code could be improved! I am using browserify and babel to transpile the React code for the web, and I'm very unfamiliar with both those tools, so the build chain can probably be improved as well.

Live demo on [my website](https://www.settinger.net/etc/pulsar/).
